# Exec_Calc

## CritDamage calculation:
- Rewrite the math, it chooses between half the CritDamage or regular damage.

## DamageReduction calculation:
- Rewrite functionality. It now only applies if we have shield, but I'm thinking more separating the two.

# Player Controller? ImpAbilitySystem doesnt initialize 
before we press certain buttons, like E (a gameplayability), Shift (nothing?). WASD+space doesnt work.
